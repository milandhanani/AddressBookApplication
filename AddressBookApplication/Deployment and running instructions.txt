Building a signed version of this application:

There is a file in the root of this directory called 'AddressBookApp' which is the keystore file for this application.
This keystore is essential because the key secrete in this keystore is used in the developer console to get auth token when required. 
Without this, you might not be able to use the application as expected.

A final release version of this APK is available on the root folder. 
The file is called 'AddressBookApplication - Release.apk'. This file can be copied onto your phone's SD card and can be installed directly.

In order to deploy this application to a cloud infastructure, you can either build a signed APK and upload it to google play store OR,
use software such as Mobi to push it to specific android devices.
