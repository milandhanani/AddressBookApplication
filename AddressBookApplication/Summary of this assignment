Summary:

The general approach:
I'm using Google+ authentication to get the auth token from the google server and then using that auth token, I'm able to get the list of contacts using an async task.
I use Async Task to get the contact list because we don't want to overload the UI thread as it may crash the application.

Features:
After spending 5 hours on this project, I was able to:
1. Get auth token from Google
2. Get contact list from Google server using your Gmail account
3. Able to get Name, Phone number and Contact Photo link
4. Implemented code to download the Contact Photo from the link but not display on the UI.
4. Display Name and Phone number in an ListView on the application

Given more time, what would I improve:
1. I'd implement the Contact Photo feature so that the application downloads the photo from the link and cache it locally to use.
2. I'd do pagination, currently, the program gets the first 50 contacts from Google, however, I could've implemented pagination such that the user can get their whole contact list.
3. I'd cache all information and store it in a local SqlLite database such that the code doens't always download contacts. It can lookup locally.
	I'd also have to implement a way to refresh stale data incase the information locally is different than what's on the google servers.
4. I'd implement caching such that not all contacts and images are loaded in memory at once.
 
This would take me 2-3 days to finish.

Given more time, how can I make this code robust:
1. I'd check if the phone had an established Internet connection, and better error handling in that case.
2. I'd improve error handling in general.
